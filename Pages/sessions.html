          such as CO for syngas (CO+H2) production, has attracted much attention. However, this generally happens at the cost of harsh conditions and harmful byproducts. 
          The paper discusses the recent discovery of a copper-indium oxide that converts CO2 to CO at the fastest rate and lower temperatures known is indeed groundbreaking!</p>

          Diels Alder reaction is one of the most celebrated reactions in organic
          chemistry. It was first described by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928. Although
          it has been over 90 years since its first use and over 70 years since it received
          the Nobel Prize, it excites chemists even today to the same extent as it did in
          the past. It has widespread applications in fields varying from natural product
          synthesis to modern material sciences besides many others.
          In spite of its extensive usage in natural and artificial systems, very few
          enzymes that catalyse Diels Alder reactions (Diels Alderases) have been found.
          There have been several attempts at making such artificial catalysts and they
          use various approaches like Lewis acid catalysis, Antibody catalysis and RNA
          catalysis to name a few. But most of them fail to give a control over reaction
          pathway and/or a stereoselective product. The current paper takes a unique
          approach to solve these problems.
          This paper exploits the Lewis acid catalysis mechanism using a metalloenzyme
          which has a completely artificially synthesized protein part and Zinc as the
          metal. This approach is unique towards making artificial enzymes, as the
          previous attempts only included making changes to the active sites of natural
          enzymes. This paper discusses the design and development of this catalyst
          evolving from a 97-amino acid, naive zinc binding protein motif (generation
          zero) to an efficient, stereoselective and pathway selective catalyst (generation
          seven) by computational as well as synthetic methods in great details. The
          characterization of enzyme further shows a turnover number >104
           per site and
          has the highest catalytic proficiency (2.9x1010 M-1 ) among all the previously
          synthesized enzymes.
          The extension of this approach, applied in the field of designing catalysts
          promises some exciting results. </p>
